  The research project applied the combination of Genode with the Fiasco.OC
  microkernel in the domain of highly scalable networking.

:Intel Labs: (Germany)

  Intel Labs at Braunschweig had a team working on NOVA with Genode as
  the user land. Unfortunately, the entire site at Braunschweig was closed
  in 2014, stopping this line of work.
  The GitHub repository is still online ([https://github.com/IntelLabs/genode]).

:IIT Madras: (India)

  The Secure-OS project of IIT Madras used Genode on Freescale i.MX6
  platforms.

:Microsoft Research: (USA)

  [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/embassies-radically-refactoring-the-web/ - Embassies: Radically Refactoring the Web]

  In this research project, Genode was used as a runtime environment on top
  of the L4ka::Pistachio microkernel to prototype a new web-browser
  architecture.
