The seL4 kernel on ARM and 64-bit x86 hardware
##############################################

With the 16.08 release we brought the seL4 support to a level to be considered
a serious combatant with the other supported kernels, however solely for the
x86_32 platform.

With this release we extended the platform support to x86_64 and to ARM in
generral. We started to upgrade from seL4 3.2.0 to seL4 5.2.0 and finally to
seL4 6.0. With the upgrade we're able to drop several Genode specific seL4
patches, as used in the 16.08 release. One major improvement of 3.2.0 compared
to 6.0 is the handling of the announcement of device memory by the kernel
to Genode's roottask 'core'.

Afterwards, we had to inspect the x86 specific part thoroughly and split and
separate it properly into platform independent and platform dependent seL4
parts. Upon this work we added platform specific x86_64 and ARM seL4 code. One
major work item was to make the page table handling in 'core' aware and
generic enough to handle the differences in the page table sizes between the
three platforms.

For the ARM support we decided to enable a i.MX6 Freescale based SoC, namely
the Wandboard Quard board. Since the seL4 kernel interface provides no timeout
support, we re-enabled for this board a previously used user-level
timer originally developed for our own base-hw kernel. The so called EPIT
timer is part of most i.MX SoCs.

After the essential work for the 3 platforms were done, surprisingly for us in
shorter time than expected, we had time to enable and work on additional
features.

First we enabled multiprocessor support for Genode/seL4 on x86 and
thread priority support for all seL4 platforms. Additionally we were able to
utilize the seL4 benchmark interface for Genode's trace infrastructure in order
to obtain utilization information about threads and CPUs. The Genode
components 'top' (text-based) and 'cpu_load_monitor' (graphical) are now
usable on Genode/seL4.
Finally, we're in general in progress of exploring the support to boot on x86
UEFI machines, which have no compatibility support module (CSM) for the legacy
BIOS boot support anymore. In this course we extended the seL4 kernel for
Genode as described by the Multiboot2 specification, which enables us to
start Genode/seL4 together with GRUB2, as a UEFI capable bootloader, on UEFI
machines without or not-enabled CSM support.

Support for boot-time initialized frame buffer
==============================================

UEFI-based systems do not carry along the legacy BIOS infrastructure, on which
our generic VESA driver depends. Hence, when booting via UEFI, one has to use
either a hardware-specific driver like our Intel-FB driver or - alternatively -
facilitate the generic UEFI mechanism.

Instead of booting in VGA text mode and leaving the switch to a graphics mode
(via real-mode SVGA BIOS subroutines) to the booted OS, UEFI employs the
so-called graphics output protocol to set up a reasonable default graphics
mode prior booting the operating system. In order to produce graphical output,
the operating system merely has no know the physical address and layout of the
frame buffer. Genode's core exposes this information as a so-called
"platform_info" ROM module. The new _fb_boot_drv_ driver picks up this
information to provide a Genode framebuffer session interface. Hence, on
UEFI-based systems, it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the VESA
driver. In contrast to the VESA driver, however, it is not able to switch
graphics modes at runtime.

The new component is located at _os/src/drivers/framebuffer/boot/_. Thanks
to Johannes Kliemann for this contribution.


Extended non-blocking operation of the VFS
==========================================

;@cproc

commit 8be641002226ac455394fcefb131c730f8e9b5d2
Author: Christian Prochaska <christian.prochaska@genode-labs.com>
Date:   Tue Aug 15 20:51:53 2017 +0200

    VFS: nonblocking interface
    
    The VFS library can be used in single-threaded or multi-threaded
    environments and depending on that, signals are handled by the same thread
    which uses the VFS library or possibly by a different thread. If a VFS
    plugin needs to block to wait for a signal, there is currently no way
    which works reliably in both environments.
    
    For this reason, this commit makes the interface of the VFS library
    nonblocking, similar to the File_system session interface.
    
    The most important changes are:
    
    - Directories are created and opened with the 'opendir()' function and the
      directory entries are read with the recently introduced 'queue_read()'
      and 'complete_read()' functions.
    
    - Symbolic links are created and opened with the 'openlink()' function and
      the link target is read with the 'queue_read()' and 'complete_read()'
      functions and written with the 'write()' function.
    
    - The 'write()' function does not wait for signals anymore. This can have
      the effect that data written by a VFS library user has not been
      processed by a file system server yet when the library user asks for the
      size of the file or closes it (both done with RPC functions at the file
      system server). For this reason, a user of the VFS library should
      request synchronization before calling 'stat()' or 'close()'. To make
      sure that a file system server has processed all write request packets
      which a client submitted before the synchronization request,
      synchronization is now requested at the file system server with a
      synchronization packet instead of an RPC function. Because of this
      change, the synchronization interface of the VFS library is now split
      into 'queue_sync()' and 'complete_sync()' functions.
    
    Fixes #2399


Make block sessions read-only by default

    Add a "writeable" policy option to the ahci_drv and part_blk Block
    servers and default from writeable to ready-only. Should a policy
    permit write acesss the session request argument "writeable" may still
    downgrade a session to ready-only.

    timer connection: no interpolation on arm w/o hw
    
    On ARM, we do not have a component-local hardware time-source. The ARM
    performance counter has no reliable frequency as the ARM idle command
    halts the counter. Thus, we do not do local time interpolation on ARM.
    Except we're on the HW kernel. In this case we can read out the kernel
    time instead.

    test the rest.

    timeout lib: dynamic interpolation-factor shift
    
    In the timeout framework, we maintain a translation factor value to
    translate between time and timestamps. To raise precision we scale-up
    the factor when we calculate it and scale-down the result of its
    appliance later again. This up and down scaling is achieved through
    left and right shifting. Until now, the shift width was statically
    choosen. However, some platforms need a big shift width and others a
    smaller one. The one static shift width couldn't cover all platforms
    which caused overflows or precision problems.
    
    Now, the shift width is choosen optimally for the actual translation
    factor each time it gets re-calculated. This way, we can take care that
    the shift always renders the best precision level without the risk for
    overflows.

    timer session: add elapsed_us method
    
    As timer sessions are not expected to be microseconds precise (because
    of RPC latency and scheduling), the session interface provided only a
    method 'elapsed_ms' although the back end of this method in the timer
    driver works with microseconds.
    
    However, in some cases it makes sense to have a method 'elapsed_us'. The
    values it returns might be milliseconds away from the "real" time but it
    allows you to work with delays smaller than a millisecond without
    getting a zero delta value.
    
    This commit is motivated by the need for fast bursts of calibration
    steps for the time interpolation in the new timer connection.

    timer connection: relax factor shifting
    
    When in modern mode (with local time interpolation), the timer
    connection used to maximize the left shifting of its
    timestamp-to-microseconds factor. The higher the shift the more precise
    is the translation from timestamps to microseconds. If the timestamp
    values used for determining the best shift were small - i.e.  the delay
    between the calibration steps were small - we may got a pretty big
    shift.  If we then used the shift with bigger timestamp values - i.e.
    called curr_time seldom or raised calibration delays - the big shift
    value became a problem. The framework had to scale down all measured
    timestamps and time values temporarily to stay operative until the next
    calibration step.
    
    Thus, we now raise the shift only that much that the resulting factor
    fullfills a given minimum. This keeps it as low as possible according
    to the precision requirement. Currently, this requirement is set to 8
    meaning that the shifted factor shall be at least 2^8 = 256.

    timer connection: fast initial calibration
    
    The calibration of the interpolation parameters was previously only done
    periodically every 500 ms. Together with the fact that the parameters
    had to be stable for at least 3 calibration steps to enable
    interpolation, it took at least 1.5 seconds after establishing a
    connection to get microseconds-precise time values.
    
    This is a problem for some drivers that directly start to poll time.
    Thus, the timer connection now does a calibration burst as soon as it
    switches to the modern mode (the mode with microseconds precision).
    During this phase it does several (currently 9) calibration steps
    without a delay inbetween. It is assumed that this is fast enough to not
    get interrupted by scheduling. Thus, despite being small, the measured
    values should be very stable which is why the burst should in most cases
    be sufficient to get the interpolation initialized.

    usb rpi: get rid of local hardware timer
    
    We used a hardware timer locally in the RPI USB driver because a timer
    connection was not precise enough to fullfill the host controllers
    requirements.
    
    With the modern timer connection interface, however, reading out time at
    a connection is microseconds precise and we can remove the local timer.
    But we cannot use the same timer connection for doing legacy-interface
    stuff like usleep (currently used in LX kit) and modern-interface stuff
    like curr_time. Thus, we open two connections for now.

    timer: generic timer_ticks_to_us implementation
    
    There are hardware timers whose frequency can't be expressed as
    ticks-per-microsecond integer-value because only a ticks-per-millisecond
    integer-value is precise enough. We don't want to use expensive
    floating-point values here but nonetheless want to translate from ticks
    to time with microseconds precision. Thus, we split the input in two and
    translate both parts separately. This way, we can raise precision by
    shifting the values to their optimal bit position. Afterwards, the results
    are shifted back and merged together again.
    
    As this algorithm is not so trivial anymore and used by at least three
    timer drivers (base-hw/x86_64, base-hw/cortex_a9, timer/pit), move it to a
    generic header to avoid redundancy.

    Some x86 machines do have a LAPIC speed < 1000 ticks per millisecond

    But we need microseconds precision for the timeout framework. Thus,
    reduce the divider dynamically until the frequency fullfills our

    By applying the text output to the alpha buffer in addition to the pixel
    buffer, labels can now appear without the need for an underlying frame
    or button.

    menu_view: fix frame dropping after sleep
    
    When idle, menu_view de-schedules timer events to save processing time.
    Once reactivated by a dialog update, it computes the passed time and
    applies the result to the animator. However, the animation was most likely
    started by the update not during the sleep. So the passed time must not
    be applied to the animation in this case. Otherwise, many animation steps
    are computed at once within a single visible frame.
    
    Furthermore, the patch adjusts the REDRAW_PERIOD to 2, which is a better
    value for geometric movements as opposed to mere color-blending effects
    where the frame rate does not matter so much.
    
    It also refines the nitpicker-buffer relocation in a way that extends
    the buffer but does not shrink it. This lowers the interaction with
    nitpicker in situations where the dialog size changes a lot.

    libc: generate nslexer.c,nsparser.c at build stage
    
    The files are generated via flex and bison. Until now, this step was
    performed when preparing the libc port. Unfortunately, the generated
    files have subtle differences depending on the flex/bison versions
    installed in the host. For example, the bison version number appears in
    the generated code. This, in turn, breaks the hash mechanism of the
    depot where a src/libc archive ends up being slightly different when
    created on different hosts.
    
    By moving the code generation to the build stage, the src/libc archive
    merely contains the nslexer.l and nsparser.y source files but not the
    generated files.

Genode as Xen DomU
==================

;@cproc

commit f57cd0b4ae06eadb592a7396c2dead37946c9fc4
Author: Christian Prochaska <christian.prochaska@genode-labs.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 7 15:24:40 2017 +0200

    run: add Xen support
    
    When building Genode on a Linux system running in a Xen Dom0, the 'xen'
    run target can run a Genode scenario in a Xen DomU.
    
    Usage: in build/x86_*/etc/build.conf, define:
    
    RUN_OPT = --include boot_dir/$(KERNEL) --include image/iso --include power_on/xen --include log/xen --include power_off/xen
    
    The Xen DomU runs in HVM mode and loads Genode from an ISO image. Serial
    log output is printed to the console and graphical output is shown in an
    SDL window.
    
    The Xen DomU ist managed using the 'xl' command line tool and it is
    possible to add configuration options in the 'xen_args' variable in a run
    script. Common options are:
    
    - disabling the graphical output:
    
      append xen_args { sdl="0" }
    
    - configuring a network device:
    
      append xen_args { vif=\["model=e1000,mac=02:00:00:00:01:01,bridge=xenbr0"\] }
    
    - configuring USB input devices:
    
      append xen_args { usbdevice=\["mouse","keyboard"\] }
    
    Note: the 'xl' tool requires super-user permissions and interactive
    password input can be troublesome in combination with 'expect' and is not
    practical for automatic tests. For this reason, the current implementation
    assumes that no password input is needed when running 'sudo xl', which can
    be achieved by creating a file '/etc/sudoers.d/xl' with the content
    'user ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/xl'
    (where 'user' is the Linux user name).
    
    Fixes #2504


Execution on bare hardware (base-hw)

UEFI support
------------

As done for the seL4 and NOVA kernel in this release, we extend our base-hw
kernel to be also a Multiboot2 compliant kernel. Used together with GRUB2,
our kernel can be run on x86 UEFI machines without or with disabled
legacy BIOS support (called CSM).

Muen separation kernel
======================

Besides updating the Muen port to the latest kernel version in the end of
June, the Muen feature has been added to Genode's automated testing
infrastructure. This includes the revived support for VirtualBox 4 on this
kernel.


NOVA microhypervisor
====================

As done for the seL4 and our own kernel 'base-hw' in this release, we extend
the NOVA kernel to be also a Multiboot2 compliant kernel. Used together with
GRUB2, NOVA can be run on x86 UEFI machines without or with disabled
legacy BIOS support (called CSM).

Grub2 provides to a Multiboot2 kernel the initial ACPI RSDP (Root System
Description Pointer) data, which are required to bootstrap the kernel and
the operating system in general on todays x86 machines. The information of
the ACPI RSDP are propagated by the kernel to Genode's 'core' and from there
via a Genode ROM called 'platform_info' to Genode's ACPI driver and the
ACPICA library based component 'acpica'.

In order to ease the setup of a UEFI bootable image, we added to our 'run'
infrastructure a new image module. The run option 'image/uefi' can be used
instead of normally used 'image/iso' to create a raw image which contains a
EFI system partition in a GUID Partition Table (GPT). The image is equipped by
the new 'image/uefi' module with the GRUB2 boot loader, a GRUB2 configuration
and the Genode run scenario. The final image can be copied with 'dd' to a
USB stick for boot on native machines. Additionally we added support to boot
such an image on Qemu leveraging Tianocores (http://www.tianocore.org) UEFI
firmware.

GRUB2 provides support to enable graphical setups early in the bootloader
and provides support to export the framebuffer information to a operating
system so that it can leverage the already enabled graphical device.

Thanks to Johannes Kliemann, we have a small Genode framebuffer driver
that obtains the required framebuffer information from GRUB2, through the NOVA
kernel and Genode 'core'. With his driver 'fb_boot_drv' one can utilize on
UEFI booted machines the framebuffer.

As a side project minor virtualisation support for AMD has been added to
Virtualbox4 and to the Nova kernel on Genode, which enabled us to run 32bit
Windows 7 VM on a 32bit Genode/NOVA host. The test machine was an (oldish)
AMD Phenom II X4.
